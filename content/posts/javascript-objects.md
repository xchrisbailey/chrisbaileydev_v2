Objects are a different way to store information. They're like arrays, but the content is accessed via key rather than index number. Objects are better used when storing things like information for a specific person, heres and example of both with same info:

```javascript
// array
var person1 = ['chris', 33, 'Detroit']

// object
var person2 = {
  name: 'Chris',
  age: 33,
  city: 'Detroit',
}
```

Both contain the same information, the object just has a verbose syntax that allows us to assign things based on a key. There are two ways to retrieve the data; bracket notation which is similar to arrays `js•person2["name"]` we just use the key value rather than index number, and dot notation `js•person2.name` which is shorter and simpler. A couple of caveats with dot notation are the key can not start with a number or contain spaces, and you can not use a variable for looking up a key in dot notation. Both will return same value of "Chris".

We also have the option of easily creating a new empty object with the `js•new Object();` method.

### Updating Data

This is same concept as changing a value in an array. It can be done through either bracket or dot notation.

```javascript
var person = {
  name: 'Chris',
  age: '33',
  city: 'Detroit',
}

// bracket notation
person['age'] += 1 // adds 1 to age making it 34

// dot notation
person.city = 'Grand Rapids' // changes city from "Detroit" to "Grand Rapids"

person // {name: "Chris", age: 34, city: "Grand Rapids"}
```

### Data

Arrays have the ability to hold many types of data. Strings, numbers, arrays, objects, and so on can all be stored inside.

```javascript
var person = {
  name: 'Chris',
  age: 33,
  city: 'Detroit',
  friends: ['Toni', 'Kevin'],
  pet: {
    name: 'Addy',
    breed: 'Goldendoodle',
    age: 9,
  },
}
```

### Nested Arrays and Objects

Both can be stored with in each other, objects in arrays or arrays in objects. This is useful for many applications be it having an array store blog posts that are objects, or an object having and array of tags for the blog post.

```javascript
var posts = [{
        title: "Dogs are the best",
        author: "Chris",
        tags = ["animals", "dogs"]
    },
    {
        title: "Cats are the worst",
        author: "Chris",
        tags = ["animals", "cats"]
    },
];

posts[0].title; // "Dogs are the best"
posts[0].tags[1]; // "dogs"
```

### Adding Methods to Objects

We have the ability to add functions to keys in an object, when doing this they are just referred to as methods. Not much changes from what we do with stand alone functions, we just need to call the name of the object before like so: `js•obj.add(1 + 2)` . An example would be `js•console.log()` where console is an object and log is a method (function).

```javascript
var doMaths = {
  add: function (x, y) {
    return x + y
  },
  subtract: function (x, y) {
    return x - y
  },
}

doMaths.add(1, 2) // 3
doMaths.subtract(2, 1) // 1
```
