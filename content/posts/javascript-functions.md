> Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

Functions are an important method for keeping code DRY and making things easily reusable through out the project.

Basic function syntax is something along the following lines:

```javascript
function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a + b
}

function myFunction2() {
  var a = 0
  return a
}
```

functions can also call other functions:

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  var a = 0
  return a
}

var num = 2

function myFunction2(a, b) {
  return a + b
}

myFunction2(myFunction(), num) // 2
```

Anonymous functions exist and are called at runtime with out any named identifer. They are flexible and can be assigned directly to a variable. There are two forms and they look like this:

```javascript
// Function Expression
var squared = function (num) {
  return num * num
}

// Arrow Expression
var cubed = num => {
  return num * num * num
}
```
